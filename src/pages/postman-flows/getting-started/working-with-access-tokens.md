A common Flows use case is to fetch an access token from a request and use that to authenticate other requests in a flow. This short video will introduce you to the concept of "[Durables](/postman-flows/core-concepts/messages/#durables)" that make this very easy in Flows.

The steps that the video follows are:

1. Use Send RequestÂ blocks to create or retrieve the access token:
   ![durables-add-requests](https://assets.postman.com/postman-labs-docs/durables/durables-add-requests.png)
2. Add more requests that use the access token:
   ![More requests](https://assets.postman.com/postman-labs-docs/durables/more-requests.png)
3. Tag the access token from the first request as a [durable](/postman-flows/core-concepts/messages/#durables):
   ![Create durables](https://assets.postman.com/postman-labs-docs/durables/add-durables.gif)
4. Use the access token in the dependent requests:
