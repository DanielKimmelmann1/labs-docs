To create a flow that executes on the cloud, create a webhook endpoint. This will run locally and you can enter test data in order to test it locally at this point.

## Release to the Cloud

Once you hit the "Release" button and give your release a name, it is now running in the cloud and toggling "Observe" will allow you to see the logs and flow of data live.

## Trigger the Webhook

Make a request to the webhook endpoint assigned to your cloud execution and then execute your flow with the data you send.
