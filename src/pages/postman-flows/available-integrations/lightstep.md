[Lightstep Incident Response](https://lightstep.com/incident-response) is an incident response platform from ServiceNow, which offers the ability to observe, assess, resolve, and escalate alerts and issues in enterprise and DevOps applications.

ServiceNow has created a Postman integration for Lightstep. This integration ingests Postman monitoring alerts into Lightstep to give visibility and remediation guidance for ops and support teams. When a configured Postman monitor fails, an alert is sent to Lightstep. Postman's [webhooks integration](/docs/integrations/webhooks/) is used to add the integration to Postman.

To use Lightstep with Postman, use the Postman integration within Lightstep to create a webhook. Then, add a webhook integration in Postman and add the URL of the Lightstep webhook.

See the [Lightstep documentation](https://lightstep.com/incident-response/docs/integrations-postman) for a step-by-step guide on how to add the Postman integration.
