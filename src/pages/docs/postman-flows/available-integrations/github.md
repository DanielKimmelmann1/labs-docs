Back up your Postman collections to GitHub, a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories, with the Postman to GitHub integration.

Setting up a GitHub integration requires you to generate a GitHub personal access token and configure how you would like to back up your collections.

> To import data into Postman from a GitHub repository, see [Importing via GitHub repositories](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-via-github-repositories).

## API sync with GitHub

Postman 9.0 introduced the ability to connect a Git repository to an API. Instead of using an integration, you can directly connect a GitHub repo to an API in the API Builder. This provides two-way sync of schemas and associated collections, plus adds powerful new features for syncing branches and release tags between Postman and your repo. For more information on the new repo sync feature, see [Versioning APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/).

## Generating a GitHub personal access token

To integrate with GitHub, you will need a GitHub personal access token.

1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
1. If you donâ€™t already have a personal access token, [generate a new one](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
1. To enable backing up collections, make sure to select the `repo` and the `user` scopes.
1. Save the generated token to use later.

> For more information about generating a token, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Backing up collections on GitHub

 You can back up a Postman collection to a GitHub repository. After you create the integration, any new changes to the collection in Postman will also appear in the GitHub repository.

1. From the **[Home](https://go.postman.co/home)** page select **[Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations)**.

    <img alt="Home page and integrations" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/home-integrations.jpg" width="500px">

1. Search and select **GitHub**.

    [![GitHub integration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/integrations-github1.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/integrations-github1.jpg)

1. Next to **Backup a collection**, select **Add Integration**.

1. Enter your GitHub **Personal Access Token** and select **Authenticate and Proceed**.

    <img alt="Access token" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/integrations-github-schema-pat.jpg" width="500px">

1. After Postman verifies the token, you can configure the integration:

   * Give the integration a nickname.
   * Select the workspace with the collection you want to back up.
   * Select a collection to back up.
   * Select the GitHub repository where you want to back up the collection.
   * Enter the directory where you want to push the collection. If the directory doesn't exist, Postman will create it for you. If you don't specify a directory, Postman will create a `Postman Collections` directory.
   * Enter the file name of the collection in the repository.
   * Enter the branch where you want to push the collection. The branch must already exist in your repository. If you don't specify a branch, Postman will push the collection to the default branch of the repository.

1. To finish setting up the integration, select **Add Integration**.

Every change saved to your Postman collection automatically commits changes to your GitHub repo in JSON format. Go to your GitHub repository to view your collections.

## Backing up collections to GitHub on a custom domain

To back up collections to GitHub on a custom domain, follow the same step as backing up a collection with the following differences:

1. After searching for the GitHub integration in Postman, select **Add Integration** next to **Backup a collection (custom domain)**.

1. Along with your personal access token, enter your GitHub custom domain, then select **Authenticate and Proceed**.

   <img alt="GitHub custom domain" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/integrations-github-custom-domain-pat.jpg" width="500px">

1. Configure the integration with your collection, repository, directory, file name, and branch.

1. To finish setting up the integration, select **Add Integration**.

### Static IP support

If your network is behind a firewall that requires IP addresses from an allowlist, you must use a static IP address to enable collection backups to GitHub on a custom domain.

Contact your IT team to allowlist the following static IP in your firewall:

* US East: `3.212.102.200`

Once you allowlist this IP address, calls for this integration will be able to connect to your network and allow the integration to work as expected.

## Troubleshooting the GitHub integration

If your GitHub integration has issues or your data isn't pushed to GitHub, check the following requirements:

* You added the GitHub integration in the same workspace as the content you want to push to the GitHub repo.
* You selected the correct GitHub integration in Postman. For example, if you use a [custom domain](#backing-up-collections-to-github-on-a-custom-domain), make sure you selected the **Backup a collection (custom domain)** integration.
* You initialized your GitHub repo with a `README.md` file. When creating a new repository, you can select the **Add a README file** check box.
* You selected the scopes `user` and `repo` when creating your GitHub [personal access token](#generating-a-github-personal-access-token).
* The branch you specified when setting up the integration already exists on GitHub. Postman won't create the branch if it doesn't already exist.
* You have permissions to push to the branch.
* If your enterprise version of GitHub is on-premises or self-hosted, check with your IT team for [firewall requirements](#static-ip-support).

Edit the integration to make any required changes. If the integration still doesn't work after you edit it, delete the integration and add it again.
