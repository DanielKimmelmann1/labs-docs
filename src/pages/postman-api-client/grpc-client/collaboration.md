> Postman Free lets teams of up to three work together at no cost. To collaborate with more team members, features, and increased usage limits, see [Plans and Pricing](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

Postman provides a variety of tools to enable and enhance collaboration within your team. You can ease the onboarding process by enabling team discovery, allowing users in your organization to request to join your Postman team. You can also create team workspaces, where team members can share their work and collaborate on API projects. Users can discuss their work directly in Postman by commenting on collections and APIs, including on specific requests, versions, and inline on schemas and scripts.

## Collection
 Collections are a group of Postman requests. They belong to a workspace. To collaborate with others on a collection, simply invite them to your current workspace.

 > **Note:** Collections with gRPC or WebSocket requests can not have HTTP requests in the same collection.

## Documentation
  You can add documentation to your gRPC requests in the editor. Documenting your gRPC requests can be a powerful way to collaborate with your team in making your APIs.

  > [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) can be used in the documentation editor for advanced formatting.

## Comments
 You can leave comments on gRPC Collections. This is useful for collaborating on a collection with your team. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) can also be used in comments for advanced formatting.
 > Team members must have access to the collection in question in order to post comments.
